Let trimmedContents be a map containing keys for every interface, and values containing the trimmed config for each interface.
Let reader be a scanner that reads in the input configuration file from Runner.java.
Let configToTrim be a file that represents the literal file on the machine that contains the input configuration.

The constructor Trimmer() shall:
    Initialize the trimmedContents LinkedHashMap.

    Check if the input path from Runner is null.
        Yes:
            Print an error message and exit.
    
    Initialize configToTrim to read the literal file.

    Try to:
        Initialize the scanner to read from configToTrim.
    If it fails:
        Print an error message and exit.

The method trimConfig() shall:
    Let currentInterface be a String representing the current interface. 
    Let excludeCommand be a boolean representing whether the current command should be excluded.
    Let commandsToAdd be an ArrayList representing every per-interface command. 
    Let currentLine be a String representing the current line.

    While reader has another line:
        // nextLine() first reads in the next line, and returns the line that was just skipped over.
        If currentLine does not start with "interface" or currentLine is null:
            Set currentLine to reader.nextLine().
        End If

        If currentLine starts with "interface Vlan".
            Return from the method.
        End If

        If currentLine starts with "interface":
            Set currentInterface to the currentLine.
            Set currentLine to reader.nextLine().

            While currentLine does not start with "interface":
                For every command in SelfConfigHelper.commandsToExclude:
                    If currentLine matches on the current command in commandsToExclude:
                        Set excludeCommand to true.
                    End If
                End For

                If excludeCommand is false and currentLine is not '!':
                    Add the current line to commandsToAdd.
                End If

                Set currentLine to reader.nextLine().
            End While
        End If

        Put into trimmedContents currentInterface as the key, and commandsToAdd as the value.
        Clear commandsToAdd.

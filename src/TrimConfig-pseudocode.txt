Test if config file already exists at: ~/Library/Application Support/TrimConfig/config.text
     If yes: 
         Read config file to load in set of default commands and input in list.
         Prompt user to input building default VLAN.
         Add 'switchport access vlan [building VLAN]' to list of default commands.
     Else: 
         Prompt user to input default commands to exclude and store in a temporary list.
         If the user's input contains 'spanning-tree portfast':
             Add 'spanning-tree portfast' to the list
             Add 'spanning-tree portfast edge' to the list
         Write header data to the location above.
         Write this data to the location above.

     Prompt user for location of file to trim.
     
Read in the specified file to trim.

While the inputted file has another line:
     Read the next line in the file

     If the line does not contain 'interface vlan':
         If the update marker is true:
             Advance the current line to the next line
         
         If the current line contains 'interface':
             Update the interface marker to the current line
             While the current line does not contain 'interface':
                 Read in the next line
                 For each command in the list of commands to exclude:
                     If the current line does not match on a command:
                         Add the command to the list of commands to add
             
             Add the interface marker as the key into the map, and the list of commands as the value
             Set the update marker to false so the line is not advanced
